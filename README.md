# Network Simulator

This is a simple full-stack network simulator that allows users to create and connect basic network objects such as hosts, routers, and switches. The frontend provides a visual interface for interacting with the network, while the backend handles storage and API communication. Nodes and links are currently placeholders and do not simulate real networking behavior yet.

## Features (Phase 1)
- Add and visualize nodes (host, router, switch)
- Connect nodes with edges
- Click nodes and edges to view details
- Delete nodes and edges
- Data is stored in memory and managed through a backend API

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React with React Flow
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Communication: REST API (JSON)

## Planned Features
- Simulated ping animations
- Node and edge editing
- Persistent storage
- Real networking logic using C++
